# üéì Placement Data Analysis ‚Äì SQL Capstone Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing **placement data** using SQL.  
The main objective is to extract **actionable insights** for students, colleges, and recruiters by studying trends in job roles, companies, salaries, and branch performance.

The project simulates a **real-world database** and applies SQL queries for:

- **Data Analysis**
- **Business Intelligence**
- **Decision Making**

## üóÇÔ∏è Database Structure

### Main Table

- **`placements`**
  - Stores placement details like Student, Branch, Company, Role, Salary, City, and Year.

### Summary / Insight Tables

1. **`avg_salary_by_branch`** ‚Üí Combined insights in one table
2. **`placements_by_graduation_year`** ‚Üí Average salary grouped by branch
3. **`popular_roles`** ‚Üí Placement trends by year
4. **`top_roles_per_course`** ‚Üí Most common job roles offered
5. **`Job Role-wise Avg Salary`** ‚Üí job role wise Average Salary

## üìä Key Insights Generated

1. **Top Companies** hiring most students.
2. **Average Salary by Branch** to compare performance of courses (e.g., CSE, AIML, ECE, MECH).
3. **Placement Rate by Graduation Year** to check trends over multiple years.
4. **City-wise Hiring & Salary Trends** to identify high-paying or high-hiring cities.
5. **Popular Job Roles** across the dataset.
6. **Branch-wise Performance** in terms of placements & salary.
7. **Top 3 Job Roles per Course** for detailed specialization insights.
